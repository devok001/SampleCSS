            <p>In recent years, the role of technology in shaping modern society has grown exponentially. From the rapid expansion of 
                artificial intelligence to the daily use of smartphones, technology influences almost every aspect of our lives. Its
                 impact is evident in industries such as healthcare, where innovations in medical devices and data analysis have improved
                  patient outcomes and extended lifespans. Education, too, has been transformed, with online learning platforms making
                   knowledge accessible to millions worldwide. However, with these advancements come new challenges, including concerns 
                   about privacy, cybersecurity, and the ethical implications of AI. As we continue to
                 navigate this digital age, society faces the complex task of balancing innovation with responsible use of technology.</p>
